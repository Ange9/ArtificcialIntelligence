    "The Breadth First Search algorithm is used for searching in data structures such as trees or graphs. For trees, the algorithm starts at the root and continues checking all the neighbors in the same level before moving to the nodes in the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this solution, the function breadthFirstSearch was defined and it uses three parameters:\n",
    "* startState : is the initial node, the algorithm will consider it as the root of the tree.\n",
    "* goalState : is the node the algorithm will look for, it will stop once this node is found.\n",
    "* successorsf : is the name of the function that is going to be used to generate \n",
    "the successors of each node.\n",
    "      \n",
    "Two data structures are used to keep track of those nodes that were already explored and those who are pending to be explored, this data structures are:\n",
    "* expanded: is a dictionary containing all the elements that have been explored. Every item in the dictionary is a tuple composed by the node and its parent.\n",
    "* unexpanded: is a list containing the  successors nodes that have not been explored yet. Every item on this list is a tuple composed by a node and its parent. This list works as a FIFO queue. The successor nodes of the current explored node are inserted, but then, after every neighbor is explored, their successors are also inserted in the list. The algorithm needs to finish first with the nodes in the current level before moving to the next level, that is why the new elements inserted go at the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing the algorithm will do is to insert the root with no parent in the unexpanded list. Once that first node is there it will loop until there are no items in the unexpanded list or the goal state is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial step in every iteration is to get the first item inserted in the unexpanded list, once that tuple is known, it is assigned to the current state and parent variables, to know the current explored node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the function name that comes as parameter, the algorithm will calculate the successors for the current node. In case the successor function is *camelSuccessorsf*, the list returned from the function will be converted to a tuple because later it will have to be inserted to the dictionary and since it is a list, it can not be used as a key value in the expanded dictionary because of the mutable property of lists. All the successors generated are stored in an array to insert them later in the unexpanded list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pair of state and parent is inserted in the expanded dictionary to know that that node have already been explored. The algorithm works with a dictionary because the order in which the items are stored in it does not matters and it will be easier to find a key and value when returning the solution path.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid inserting duplicate items to the data structures, the algorithm removes from the list of successors all those items that are already in the expanded dictionary or in the unexpanded list. After removing all the duplicates, for every successor a pair with the successor and the current parent is inserted at the end of the unexpanded list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Storing the succesors with their parents in the unexpanded list is used to know what are the nodes in the next level that needs to be explored after exploring all the nodes in the current level. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last step on every loop is to check if the goal state is present in the list of succesors of the current node, if so, it will return the solution path. The solution path is a list that contains all the trace to go from the goal state to the start state. To generate the solution path, the algorithm takes the node's parent, that is stored with the node in the list as a tuple, and with that parent node as a key, finds the  parent's parent from the expanded dictionary. After that, the new node that will be searched in the dictionary will be the parent's parent. This loop is repeated until the root is found. \n",

I spent some time realizing that dictionaries do not keep elements in the order they were inserted, so it was not a good idea to represent  the unexpanded list with a dictionary, since elements needs to be inserted and removed in a certain order depending on the algorithm. I changed it to a list and I was to much easier.\n",

After knowing that, I changed the key and value that are going to be inserted to a tuple and I was able to add the new items to the dictionary.\n",
